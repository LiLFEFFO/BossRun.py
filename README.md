# BossRun.py
BossRun game using Pygame.
There are 6 levels in this game. (But i'm sure i will add some more soon)
Once you kill the current boss you will immediately begin the fight with the next boss.
In the beginning of every level the game will refill your HP.
K is for attacking.
SPACEBAR is for dashing.
WASD is for moving.
If you touch the boss it will deal damage to you
Copy the code in the other file, prin it in VS code, run it and i hope you enjoy!
